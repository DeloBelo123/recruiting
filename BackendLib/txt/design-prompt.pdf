Create a JSON profile design system that extracts visual data from these screenshots
so that I can use the JSON output in Cursor to give it context on how to replicate such design systems
in a consistent style. Avoid including the contents of the specific images. 
The output should include the design style, the structure and anything that`ll help an AI replicate such designs
```

für Struktur und Komponenten übernahme, farbe jedoch von der globals.css datei
```
Create a JSON profile design system that extracts only the **structure and components** from these screenshots 
so that I can use the JSON output in Cursor to replicate the website layout and component hierarchy
in a consistent style. **Do not include the colors from the screenshots**. 
Instead, use the colors defined in my `globals.css` file for all styling. 
The output should include component types, layout positions, spacing, typography sizes, and any structural details 
that will help an AI replicate the design accurately while keeping my own color scheme.

You are now in Agent Mode. Build a website based on the JSON-schema in the design.json file.
Use the design specifications exactly (colors, typography, layout), 
but generate placeholder content for text and images. 
Do not invent new colors or fonts.
